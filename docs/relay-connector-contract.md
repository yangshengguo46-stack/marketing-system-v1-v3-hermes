# Relay ↔ Connector Contract (v1, EXPERIMENTAL)

> **Status:** EXPERIMENTAL. This contract MAY CHANGE without a deprecation
> cycle until at least two real Class-1 platforms (Discord + Telegram) have
> validated it. Evolution during the experimental phase is **additive-only**,
> gated by `contract_version`. A breaking change updates both repos in lockstep.

This document is the formal interface between the **Hermes gateway** (Python,
`gateway/relay/`) and the **connector** (Node/TypeScript,
`NousResearch/gateway-gateway`). The connector implementer's first action is to
read this file.

The gateway runs a generic `RelayAdapter` that dials **out** to the connector,
receives a `CapabilityDescriptor` at handshake, then exchanges normalized
`MessageEvent`s (inbound) and actions (outbound) over a per-turn bidirectional
WebSocket. The gateway never learns which concrete platform is fronting it; the
connector owns all platform-specific socket/identity logic.

---

## 1. Handshake

1. Gateway opens the transport (`connect`).
2. Gateway calls `handshake()`; connector returns a `CapabilityDescriptor`
   (section 2) describing the platform this adapter instance fronts.
3. Gateway configures the adapter from the descriptor (char limit, length unit,
   draft/edit/thread/markdown capabilities) and registers an inbound handler.
4. Connector then streams inbound events and accepts outbound actions.

`contract_version` (currently `1`) is carried in the descriptor. The gateway
ignores unknown descriptor fields (forward-compat) and fills missing optional
fields from defaults.

---

## 2. CapabilityDescriptor (handshake payload)

JSON object. Source of truth: `gateway/relay/descriptor.py`.

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `contract_version` | int | yes | Contract version (additive-only within a version). |
| `platform` | string | yes | Platform name (e.g. `"discord"`, `"telegram"`). |
| `label` | string | yes | Human-readable label. |
| `max_message_length` | int | yes | Char limit; gateway exposes as `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH`. 0 → treat as 4096. |
| `supports_draft_streaming` | bool | yes | Native draft-streaming preview support. |
| `supports_edit` | bool | yes | Edit-based streaming possible; if false, consumer degrades to one-message-per-segment. |
| `supports_threads` | bool | yes | `create_handoff_thread` capability. |
| `markdown_dialect` | string | yes | `"plain"`, `"markdown_v2"`, `"discord"`, … (drives `supports_code_blocks`). |
| `len_unit` | string | yes | `"chars"` (builtin len) or `"utf16"` (Telegram UTF-16 code units). |
| `emoji` | string | no | Display emoji (default 🔌). |
| `platform_hint` | string | no | System-prompt platform hint. |
| `pii_safe` | bool | no | Redact PII in session descriptions. |

Most fields are a projection of the gateway's existing `PlatformEntry`; the
runtime-only fields (`len_unit`, `supports_*`, `markdown_dialect`) come from the
live platform adapter's capability methods.

## 3. Inbound: `MessageEvent` envelope

The connector normalizes each platform wire event into a `MessageEvent`
(`gateway/platforms/base.py`) and delivers it to the gateway's inbound handler.
The gateway keys the session via `build_session_key()` from the embedded
`SessionSource` — so populating the right discriminators is the single
highest-correctness responsibility of the connector.

### SessionSource discriminators per platform

| Platform | chat_id | chat_type | user_id | thread_id | guild_id |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Discord** | channel id | `dm`/`group`/`thread` | author id | thread channel id (threads) | **guild id** (REQUIRED for server isolation) |
| **Telegram** | chat id | `dm`/`group`/`forum` | from id | forum topic id (forums) | — |

**Get Discord's `guild_id` wrong and two servers collide into one session.**
This is the #1 High-severity risk. The gateway's `build_session_key()` is the
conformance oracle: for a given `SessionSource`, the connector's normalization
must produce the same key the Python adapter would. (The Phase-1 stub tests
assert known-input → known-key.)

### Bot identity vs tenant (single-bot consolidation, Appendix A)

The envelope carries the **originating bot identity** as a field **distinct from
tenant**. Tenant is resolved from the event's own discriminator (Discord
`guild_id`, Telegram `chat_id`, webhook path/subdomain) — **never** from which
token/socket/process delivered it. This keeps one shared bot able to front many
tenants (Phase 6) without overloading an existing field.

---

## 4. Outbound: action set

The gateway calls the transport with action dicts. Source of truth:
`gateway/relay/transport.py` + `gateway/relay/adapter.py`.

| `op` | Fields | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `send` | `chat_id`, `content`, `reply_to?`, `metadata?` | `{success: bool, message_id?, error?}` |
| `edit` | `chat_id`, `message_id`, `content`, `metadata?` | `{success: bool, error?}` |
| `typing` | `chat_id` | `{success: bool}` |

`get_chat_info(chat_id)` is a separate proxied call returning at least
`{name, type}`. Media actions follow the same envelope shape (deferred to a
later contract revision; additive).

---

## 5. Interrupt (`/stop`) routing

- **Gateway → connector:** `send_interrupt(session_key, reason?)` egresses a
  mid-turn `/stop`. The connector MUST forward it down the socket owned by the
  gateway instance running that `session_key` (the routing invariant).
- **Connector → gateway:** an inbound interrupt for a `session_key` is bridged
  by the adapter's `on_interrupt(session_key, chat_id)` into the existing
  per-session interrupt mechanism, cancelling exactly that turn (siblings
  untouched).

The interrupt rides the same per-turn bidirectional socket as inbound/outbound.

---

## 6. Signed-body handling (passthrough plane)

Webhook signatures (Discord ed25519, Twilio HMAC, WeCom BizMsgCrypt) are
computed over **exact raw bytes**. The connector:

- **verifies at the edge** for coarse per-tenant auth/ratelimit/routing (it holds
  tenant secrets), AND
- **forwards the signed body byte-for-byte** (no JSON re-serialize, no header
  reordering) so the gateway's existing crypto validates against unmodified
  bytes.

---

## 7. Versioning policy

- `contract_version` is an int; bump **only** for additive changes during the
  experimental phase (new optional fields, new `op`s).
- A breaking change (renamed/removed field, changed semantics) requires a
  coordinated update of both repos and a version bump.
- The connector's first PR references the commit SHA of this file it implements
  against.
